This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook, used for learning and testing ideas around Kalman Filters. 

### Identify state using dispersal
5s window measure radius encompassing trajectory

```{r}
## Code 
```

## State Space Notation 

The standard way of representing these systems uses matrix notation :
\[\dot{\bf{x}}  = \bf{Fx} + Gu + w  \], where $u$ is the input vector and $w$ the noise.
The 1st order LP filter from above put in to this form would simply be F=-1/T,G=0,w=\eta/T.
